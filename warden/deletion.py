"""The removal gate: code is commented out only after two opposite tests pass.

WHY

A suite that stays green does not prove deleted code was unused. On CNS,
three of four "unused" findings were pytest hooks that the framework calls by
name; deleting them would have passed the tests and silently dropped an
enforcement rule. Silent loss is the failure a deletion test cannot see.

THE TWO TESTS, in one cycle, both required

  keep test    "what happens if I don't delete it?" The code stays, but Warden
               temporarily makes it fail loudly (it raises when it runs). If
               the suite stays green, nothing runs it. If the suite goes red,
               something uses it, and the removal is refused. A hook that is
               called by name fails here instead of vanishing quietly.
  delete test  "what happens if I take it out?" The code is commented out, never
               deleted, each block stamped with the time and the Ghost finding.
               Applied under the usual gate: suite green before and after,
               Ghost finds nothing new, put back on any failure.

The keep test always restores the files, pass or fail. Without Ghost, the
suite, or a way to name and trap the code, nothing is touched.
