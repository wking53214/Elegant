"""The loop: Ghost sees, Drafter proposes, Warden decides and applies, SWIZZLE checks.

    calibrate (SWIZZLE proves its own instrument)
    repeat, up to max_cycles:
        observe (Ghost) -> Drafter proposes -> authorize (human)
        -> suite before -> apply -> suite after (put back on failure)
        -> Ghost re-inspects
      until the Drafter has nothing left to propose
    SWIZZLE proofs again
    hand off ONCE to the Finisher: beautified code and the final README,
      applied by Warden under the same gate and put back if the suite
      breaks or Ghost finds anything new

Warden is the only writer and the only one who says the loop is done. The
Drafter cannot declare itself finished; it can only run out of proposals, and
Warden checks that Ghost agrees before calling it converged.

This module refuses three self-certifying loops:

    Warden says Warden is good.
    Ghost Tools finds its own work correct merely because it produced it.
    SWIZZLE trusts the transformation framework without independent challenge.
