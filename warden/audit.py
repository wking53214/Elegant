"""Rules 5 and 9: the defect audit file, with IDs that never change meaning.

Elegant.md, Rule 9: "Every defect gets a stable ID in a single source of
truth (e.g. `WARDEN_AUDIT.md`) ... IDs never reuse meanings once
published." Rule 5: document defects before fixing them.

`defects_from_ghost` numbers findings in scan order (C1, H1, ... per run), so
the same label can name a different defect tomorrow. That is fine for one
report and wrong for an audit. This module keeps the labels durable by
reading the audit file it wrote last time:

  - a finding already in the file keeps its ID, matched by Ghost's own ID;
  - a new finding gets the next unused number for its priority;
  - a finding that has left the scan keeps its row and its ID, marked
    "not seen in latest scan". It is never deleted and the ID is never given
    to anything else. A human marks it Fixed with the commit SHA.

Only the table between the markers is Warden's. Everything else in the file
(design analogy, layer map, invariants, notes) is the author's and is carried
over byte for byte.
