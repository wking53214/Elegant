"""Run Warden's instruments (SWIZZLE, Ghost Tools, ASSAY grading) away from the target.

`python -m swizzle.cli` puts the current directory first on the import path.
If Warden is started from inside the target, a `swizzle/cli.py` planted in the
target would be run and believed. So every instrument runs with:

  - a fresh empty directory as its working directory,
  - `-P`, so Python does not add the working directory to the import path,
  - instrument roots turned into absolute paths first,
  - only absolute entries kept from any inherited PYTHONPATH.

The target's own test suite is the one thing that still runs inside the
target. That cannot be avoided: running those tests is the point.
