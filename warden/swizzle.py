"""SWIZZLE consumer: is the adversary's own instrument sound?

SWIZZLE owns adversarial challenge. Warden must not become SWIZZLE. What
Warden asks of it is one calibration question before it will write anything:
do SWIZZLE's own planted defects still all get proven? (`swizzle prove`).

The independent post-change oracle used to live here. It judges documentation,
which is a craft question, so it moved to Burnish with the rest of the
beautification. Warden now receives its verdict through `warden.craft`.
