# Warden

*Formerly Elegant. Renamed in October 2026; the role is unchanged.*

The discipline of change.

Warden decides whether a change to code may be made, whether it stands once
made, and what is recorded about it. It does not decide what makes code
beautiful. That work lives in [Burnish](https://github.com/wking53214/burnish),
which plugs into Warden through one small interface.

It is not a formatter, not a linter, not a beauty scorer, and not an automatic
rewriting bot. Nothing is written without a named human.

## WHAT THIS IS

A governor, and the only thing in the stack that writes. It runs a loop. Ghost
Tools reports what is wrong, the Drafter proposes one fix, and Warden asks, in
order: did a person grant this, are SWIZZLE's own proofs sound, is the target's
test suite green, did it stay green after the change, and does Ghost agree
nothing new appeared. Any "no" stops the change or puts it back. The loop
cycles until the Drafter has nothing left to propose (or a cycle limit is
hit). Only then does Warden hand the code, once, to the Finisher, together with the facts it measured (the suite result and what Ghost still reports), so the Finisher counts and detects nothing itself. The Finisher beautifies the code and writes the final README. The Finisher's change goes through
the same gate.

Version `0.8.0`. Stdlib only. Python 3.11 or newer; CI runs 3.11 and 3.12.

## WHY IT EXISTS

Beautifying code is easy to do badly: a cleanup that quietly changes behavior,
a rewrite nobody approved, a verdict that certifies its own author's work.
Warden is the part that makes those failures impossible to do quietly. It was
split out of the original Warden, which mixed this discipline with the
opinion about what better code looks like. The opinion moved to Burnish on
2026-10-08 so each can be judged on its own.

## WHAT IT OWNS

- Transformation proposals as data: reason, target, baseline, preservation, evidence
- The human authorization boundary (`UNKNOWN` is not `APPROVED`; Warden cannot authorize itself)
- Rule 7, the test gate: the target's own suite before and after every write
- Rule 9, the audit file: `WARDEN_AUDIT.md`, Ghost findings under IDs that never change meaning
- The SWIZZLE proof gate: SWIZZLE's own proofs must hold before anything is accepted
- The tag-team loop that *calls* Ghost Tools, SWIZZLE, a Drafter and a Finisher without becoming any of them
- The Four Horsemen interface: typed handoffs between ASSAY, Ghost Tools, SWIZZLE and Warden

## WHAT IT DOES NOT OWN

- Which fix to propose (Drafter), and the beautifying and final README (Burnish)
- Forensic detectors, ledgers, mutation (Ghost Tools)
- Independent oracles and ground truth (SWIZZLE)
- Row shapes and interoperability contracts (CNS), which Warden never modifies
- Live admission, decision, conservation, execution, custody
- A numeric elegance score

|---|---|
| `warden.epistemic` | GUARANTEED / VERIFIED / IMPLEMENTED / DESIGNED / ASSUMED / UNKNOWN / NOT_IMPLEMENTED / INTENTIONALLY_NOT_PROVIDED |
| `warden.models` | Defect, Transformation, FileEdit; consumes `ghost-*` IDs |
| `warden.authorization` | grant / refuse; self-grant is Unauthorized |
| `warden.roles` | the two seats: Drafter (in the loop) and Finisher (once, after it) |
| `warden.tagteam` | the loop |
| `warden.suite` | Rule 7: runs the target's own test suite before and after a change |
| `warden.audit` | Rules 5 and 9: `WARDEN_AUDIT.md` |
| `warden.swizzle` | the SWIZZLE proof gate |
| `warden.ghost` | JSON consumer plus an optional read-only scan |
| `warden.registry` | campaign record; the current one is `docs/REGISTRY.json` |
| `warden.horsemen` | typed handoffs, scoped grants, receipts. `AssayAdapter` reads ASSAY's `assay_production/registry.json` and raises `AssayUnavailable` rather than return no specimens |
| `warden.isolation` | runs SWIZZLE, Ghost and ASSAY grading in an empty directory, with absolute roots |

| `warden.textio` | byte-faithful reads and writes: line endings kept, non-UTF-8 files refused |
| `warden.cli` | `tagteam` and `audit`; the exit-code table and the seat handshake |

## KEY INTERNAL CONCEPTS

- **Governor, not judge.** A Drafter or Finisher never outvotes a red suite, a missing grant, or a new Ghost finding.
- **Converged is not clean.** The loop ends when the Drafter has nothing left, not when Ghost reports zero; the notes say how many findings remain.
- **One intentional change.** Ambiguous replacements refuse.
- **Identity.** Ghost's hash is the machine identity. C1/H1/M1/L1 are labels.
- **Self-certification is a bug.** Warden cannot grant actor `warden` / `self` / `unknown`.
- **One-way dependency.** Drafter and Burnish import Warden's data shapes. Warden imports neither.

## IMPORTANT BOUNDARIES

Warden does not sit on Admission → Custody.
A CNS mention is not a CNS seam.
Running a repository's tests runs its code, so Rule 7 happens only after a human grant.

## LIFECYCLE / EXECUTION MODEL

CLI over a git work tree. Default is read-only. Writes require
`--authorize ACTOR --reason TEXT`.

`warden tagteam PATH --drafter MODULE:FACTORY --finisher MODULE:FACTORY --ghost-root GHOST_TOOLS --swizzle-root SWIZZLE --assay-root ASSAY --assay-floor N`
runs the whole loop and the hand-off (`--max-cycles`, default 10). Without
`--drafter` it can only observe (`INCONCLUSIVE`). Without `--finisher` it stops
when the loop converges.
Without `--authorize` it proposes and writes nothing (`REFUSED`). `--reason` must
not be empty. If SWIZZLE's own proofs do not hold, nothing is written and the
command exits 2. The target path must be an existing folder, or the command exits 2
at once. Without
`--swizzle-root` the notes say `SWIZZLE proofs NOT RUN` and the adversary is
uncalibrated.

A run that does not end `ACCEPT` or `ACCEPT_UNVERIFIED` leaves the tree as it
found it. Warden takes a snapshot at the start of every run, and if the run
ends any other way (rejected, not converged, suite red, a seat failed) after
changes were made, the whole tree is restored and the notes say so. The
proposals stay in the cycle records so a person can see what was tried. If the
tree is too big to snapshot, the notes and the last decision text say so
loudly and nothing is restored.

Exit codes for `tagteam` (the same table is in `warden tagteam --help`). Only 0 means
the change was accepted, so a CI job can trust the exit code alone:

| code | decision | what it means |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `ACCEPT` | Measured, judged, and standing. The only success. |
| 1 | `REJECT`, `JUDGE_REJECTED`, `NOT_CONVERGED`, `FINISH_REJECTED` | The change was rejected, did not settle, or the finishing step was refused. Anything else that is a rejection also exits 1. |
| 2 | (usage error, seat not loaded, or SWIZZLE unsound) | The command was used wrongly (for example, the target folder does not exist), a seat could not be loaded or asked for a different contract, or SWIZZLE's own proofs do not hold. Nothing was written. |
| 3 | `ACCEPT_UNVERIFIED` | The changes stand, but a check did not run or the Judge could not decide. Not approved. |
| 4 | `ERROR` | A seat failed or gave the wrong kind of answer. Nothing was approved. |
| 5 | `REFUSED` | No human authorization (or an empty reason, or a name Warden will not accept). A proposal may have been shown. Nothing was written. |
| 6 | `INCONCLUSIVE` | A needed measurement could not be made: Ghost is down or timed out, the suite was red from the start, or the ASSAY key could not be used. Nothing was written. |

A decision the code does not know exits 1, never 0. The JSON always has `decision`,
`notes`, `unmeasured`, and `reason`. `reason` is one plain sentence saying why a run
that was not a plain `ACCEPT` ended as it did. `unmeasured` is true: it names `ghost`
when Ghost was down, timed out, scanned nothing or gave unreadable output, `suite`
when the suite was never run, `swizzle` when its proofs failed or could not run, and
`assay` when the answer key was unusable, and `ghost_partial` when Ghost ran but
could not look at everything it should have (see below). `warden audit` exits 2 when it cannot read
the findings or will not write; it never prints a clean-looking report for a Ghost
that looked at nothing.

**Old and new Ghost.** Warden reads both. Old Ghost prints a bare list of findings. New
Ghost prints an object with `status`, `scan` counts and an `unmeasured` list, and exits
0 clean, 1 findings, 2 did not start, 3 crashed. Exit 3 ends the run as `INCONCLUSIVE`
with a reason that says Ghost crashed (a fault in Ghost, never a finding and never a
clean scan); exit 2 is reported as Ghost not starting. The output JSON gains
`ghost_scan` (status, file counts, `gaps`, `declined`; null for old Ghost) and
`drafter_skipped` (the Drafter's own reasons for leaving findings alone, from
`describe_skipped()` when it has one; at most 20 lines of 200 characters, cleaned of
control characters; information, never a gap).

**What counts as a gap.** Only an `unmeasured` row that Ghost does not mark as asked for
(`by_request` true; `requested` is read as the same thing). Checks the caller declined
(`--no-tests` and the like, which Warden passes on purpose) and opt-in checks nobody
requested (`mutate`, `kernel`) are listed under `declined` and change nothing, so a
clean default run can still be a plain `ACCEPT`. Everything else is a gap: unparsable
files, a detector that raised, git missing when Ghost needs it, a row that does not say
who asked for it, or `status: incomplete` with no reason. A gap puts `ghost_partial` in
`unmeasured`, so the Judge sees it and the run ends `ACCEPT_UNVERIFIED` at best, never
a plain `ACCEPT`. (A target that is not a git repository is such a gap: Ghost's
`branches` check cannot run there.)

**Ids.** Warden compares Ghost ids only within one run, so the one-time id change in
new Ghost does not disturb the loop unless `--from-ghost` findings from old Ghost are
mixed with a live scan from new Ghost (do not). `warden audit` keeps its human ids
across the change: a row whose Ghost id is gone adopts the new id of a finding with the
same detector, summary and line whose path is the old path with folders in front, only
when that match is unique both ways. Anything else becomes a new row, as before.

**Reading the instruments.** Warden believes an instrument only when it is exact.
`swizzle prove` must exit 0 and print a whole line `N of M proofs hold` with N equal
to M and M at least 1 (`0 of 0` and `1 of 12` are not sound). SWIZZLE's governor
report counts only if it exited 0 or 1 and every item has text for `scenario`,
`severity` and `status`, with the status exactly `held` or `violated`; otherwise the
whole report is "not measured" and the note says why, with the end of SWIZZLE's own
error text. The ASSAY card must hold a list of records with at least one failure-mode
specimen and only outcomes Warden knows. Ghost gets a time limit (`--ghost-timeout`,
default 600 seconds), must return a list of records whose ids are text, and counts as
not measured if it says it scanned nothing.

**The handshake with the other repositories.** Judge, Drafter and Burnish build
against Warden's shapes (`Evidence`, `Verdict`, `Facts`, `Transformation`). Warden
exposes `warden.CONTRACT` (now `"1"`) and raises it only when one of those shapes
changes in a way that breaks a seat written for the old shape. Every seat must declare
`requires_contract = "1"` (a class or instance attribute). When it names any other
version, or declares nothing, `warden tagteam` refuses to run, says which, and exits 2
with `SEAT_NOT_LOADED`. Nothing is run and nothing is written. There is no switch to
skip the check: Judge, Drafter and Burnish all declare it, so it would only let an
unchecked seat govern a run. The JSON names the contract Warden checked
(`contract`) and the versions that took part (`versions`: Warden's version and
contract; the commit and `pyproject.toml` version of each of `--ghost-root`,
`--swizzle-root` and `--assay-root` that was given; and for each seat that was loaded
its `spec`, declared `requires_contract`, installed `version` and `commit`). A value
that cannot be found is `null`.
A Judge verdict with no judge name or with extra fields is reported in the notes
and does not crash the run.

**Releasing, and the seats' pins.** Judge, Drafter and Burnish each depend on one exact Warden
commit or `vX.Y.Z` tag, not on `main`. After a Warden change that seats must pick up (any change
to `CONTRACT`, or to what a seat is checked for), tag the merge commit `vX.Y.Z` (matching
`version` in `pyproject.toml`), then open one pull request per seat that moves its pin
(see "Bumping the Warden pin" in each seat's README). Merge seats before the Warden change that
needs them: this release makes a seat without `requires_contract` refuse to load, so the seats
must declare it first.

A proposal that changes nothing is dropped as `NOTHING_TO_PROPOSE`, not counted as
applied. A proposal that is outside the grant's scope and cites no defect is declined
(nothing is written) and the loop goes on, as long as scope is the only thing wrong
with it; asking for the same thing twice ends the run as `NOT_CONVERGED`. A proposal
that also touches a test file, CI, or a path outside the target is still `REJECT`.

`ERROR` means a seat (Drafter, Finisher, Judge) raised an exception or gave
the wrong kind of answer. The notes name the seat and the kind of exception,
never a traceback, and the tree is put back.

Rule 7 is enforced on every authorized write: the suite must be green before
the change, or nothing is written; after it, no new failures and at least as
many passes, or the change is put back and the decision is `REJECT`. Both
counts are in the output.

`warden audit PATH --ghost-root GHOST_TOOLS` prints `WARDEN_AUDIT.md` with
every Ghost finding under a C/H/M/L ID. Existing IDs keep their meaning, new
findings get new numbers, and a finding that left the scan keeps its row. With
`--authorize ACTOR --reason TEXT` it writes the file. Only the table between
its markers is Warden's; every other section survives reruns untouched.

## WHAT WORKS

- Transformation apply refuses without a grant. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_authorization.py`.
- Ghost IDs are preserved. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_ghost_identity.py`.
- Tag team without a grant does not write; without a drafter it only observes. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_tagteam.py`.
- The loop cycles until the drafter runs dry, stops at the cycle limit, and notices a drafter going in circles. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_tagteam.py`.
- The finisher runs once, only after convergence. A finishing change that breaks the suite is put back, and because the run is then not accepted, the loop's edits are put back too. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_tagteam.py` and `tests/test_closing_false_accepts.py`.
- With `--assay-root` and `--swizzle-root`, Ghost is graded against ASSAY's answer key before anything is written; an unproven key or an ungradable specimen stops the run, and the score goes to the Judge with the floor (default 3 of 5, where Ghost stands today). **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_assay_in_loop.py`, and live on CNS (Ghost caught 3 of 5).
- SWIZZLE's proofs failing stops the write; not configuring SWIZZLE is said out loud. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_tagteam.py`.
- A change that breaks the target's suite is put back; a red or empty suite means nothing is written. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_rule7_suite_gate.py`.
- Audit IDs survive reruns, are never reused, and a Fixed defect that returns is reopened under its own ID. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_audit.py`.
- No Warden module imports Burnish, Drafter or any other repository in the stack, and none of the beautification modules remain. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_independence.py`.
- A run that does not end accepted leaves the tree as found (rejected, not converged, suite red in a later cycle, a seat that raises or returns the wrong type). The CLI always prints valid JSON. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_closing_false_accepts.py`.
- The target cannot pose as an instrument: SWIZZLE, Ghost and ASSAY grading run in an empty directory, with absolute roots and without the current directory on the import path. Stack names (judge, assay, drafter, burnish, ghost, swizzle, ghost_tools, the warden) cannot authorize changes to Warden's own tree. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_closing_false_accepts.py`.
- No edit, proposal or finish may touch `.git`, `.hg`, `.svn`, virtual environments, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `site-packages` or tool caches. A seat that changes `.git/hooks`, `.git/config` or `.git/info` is caught and the files are put back. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_closing_false_accepts.py`.
- A Ghost id with odd characters cannot put code in a file: ids are cut down to letters, digits and `_ . : -`, on one line, 64 characters at most. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_closing_false_accepts.py`.
- A removal is declined when the baseline suite has any skipped or xfailed test, and when the code is vendored or generated. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_closing_false_accepts_2.py`.
- A suite that changes source files stops the run as `INCONCLUSIVE`. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_closing_false_accepts_2.py`.
- The keep test saves the original files outside the target before it plants a trap, and the next run restores them if a kill left a trap behind. Two runs on one target cannot overlap. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_closing_false_accepts_2.py`.
- Restores are byte for byte. CRLF files stay CRLF, and a file that is not valid UTF-8 is never edited. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_closing_false_accepts_2.py`.
- `warden audit --authorize` will not overwrite a hand-written audit file that has no markers and will not write through a link or outside the target. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_closing_false_accepts_2.py`.
- ASSAY's answer key arrives, or the run says why it did not. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_assay_link.py`, including a live read when `ASSAY_ROOT` is set (CI sets it).
- Exit codes are honest: only `ACCEPT` exits 0, and each row of the table above has a test; an unknown decision never exits 0; `warden audit` exits 2 when it cannot read findings or will not write. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_honest_exit_codes.py`.
- `unmeasured` names the instrument that was down (Ghost, suite, SWIZZLE, ASSAY) and every non-`ACCEPT` result has a one-sentence `reason`. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_honest_exit_codes.py`.
- SWIZZLE, Ghost and ASSAY output is read strictly, a hung Ghost times out as unavailable, and garbled Ghost output after an edit puts the tree back. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_honest_exit_codes.py`.
- The seat handshake (`requires_contract`: a mismatch or a missing declaration is refused, and the output names the `contract` and `versions`), a missing or non-folder target, an empty reason, a no-op proposal and an out-of-scope proposal are handled as described above. **VERIFIED** by `tests/test_honest_exit_codes.py`.
- The whole loop with the real SWIZZLE, ASSAY, Ghost, Drafter and Judge, on a small scratch project, ended `ACCEPT` with exit 0 on 2026-10-09 (a check by hand, not a recorded test).

313 tests exist in this tree. All pass on CPython 3.13 except the one live ASSAY read, which is skipped without `ASSAY_ROOT` and which CI runs on 3.11 and 3.12. The full run takes about 6 minutes.

## WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL

The refusal is in the type of the work, not in a comment: `apply` checks
`authorization.granted` before a path is opened.

## WHAT IS IMPLEMENTED

The modules in the table above and the two CLI commands. No network.

## WHAT IS PROVEN

The tests named above. The whole loop, live, once on 2026-10-07 (before the
split): SWIZZLE 12 of 12 proofs, Ghost Tools observe and re-inspect, an
authorized change, oracle ACCEPT, on a scratch demo. Recorded in
`docs/REGISTRY.json`. That is not a proof of the architecture.

## WHAT IS NOT PROVEN

- The loop run live with a real Drafter and Finisher, on any repository. It has not been run since the split.
- Live `ghost-buster` + `warden tagteam` + `swizzle prove` on a corpus repository.

## WHAT DOES NOT WORK

- Warden makes no change by itself. With no drafter it cannot propose anything.
- `WARDEN_AUDIT.md`'s design analogy, layer map and invariants are written by
  a person; Warden leaves them `UNKNOWN` rather than invent them.
- Beauty is not scored here or anywhere in the corpus.

## WHAT IS STILL UGLY

- The live Ghost scan shells out to `python -m ghost_buster.cli`. That is a
  process boundary, not a typed import, because Warden must not become Ghost Tools.
- `docs/PHASE0_INVENTORY.json` and the first registry row describe the
  pre-split Warden. They are history and say so.

## KNOWN DEFECTS

- The target's own test suite still runs inside the target, with the target's code. A hostile suite can do anything the user can do. Warden now notices a suite that rewrites source files, but not one that does something else.
- Only the keep test is protected from a kill (SIGKILL) by the journal. If Warden is killed at another moment, edits it had already applied stay on disk, and the next run does not know about them.
- The lock is advisory and works on one machine. It stops two Warden runs, not a person editing at the same time.
- A tree too large to snapshot (over 200 MB) cannot be put back. The notes say so, and a failed run leaves its edits.
- The forbidden and vendored directory lists go by folder name. A real source folder named `env`, `gen`, `build` or `vendor` will not be edited.
- A suite with skipped or xfailed tests blocks every removal, even for code those tests do not touch. That is on purpose: Warden cannot tell which code they would have covered.
- Files that are not valid UTF-8 are reported at most by Ghost and are never edited.
- Ghost Tools does not flag a documented test count larger than the suite;
  `doc_test_count_drift` only reports a count the suite has grown past.
- With no `--swizzle-root`, a change can still be ACCEPTed. The notes say the
  adversary is uncalibrated; the decision itself does not change.
- Ghost reports how many files it scanned only on its error stream (`scanning N file(s)`), not in its JSON. Warden reads that line; if Ghost stops printing it, Warden cannot tell a clean tree from an empty one, except when Ghost itself exits with an error.
- A run whose only proposals were all declined as out of scope ends as `ACCEPT` or `ACCEPT_UNVERIFIED` with nothing changed; the cycle records say `DECLINED`, and the Judge sees them.
- `versions` reports what it can read from files (`.git`, `pyproject.toml`, installed package metadata). A checkout that is not a git folder, or a seat installed without version information, shows `null` for that field. SWIZZLE finds Ghost and ASSAY itself (`$GHOST_TOOLS`, `$ASSAY`, a sibling folder) when Warden does not pass them; in that case Warden does not know which copy SWIZZLE used.
- SWIZZLE attacks that did not run are noted but do not by themselves turn an `ACCEPT` into `ACCEPT_UNVERIFIED`; the Judge receives them as not measured.

## ARCHITECTURAL DEBT

- No typed Ghost Tools adapter beyond JSON.
- SWIZZLE's `TargetAdapter` for Warden lives in the SWIZZLE repository, not here.

## WHAT REMAINS OUTSTANDING

A live run with Drafter and Burnish in their seats, recorded in the registry.

## CLAIMS VS REALITY

Here is what the artifact says it is: a governor of change that will not write
without a human grant and will not keep a change that breaks the suite.

Here is what we can establish: the executed suite named under WHAT WORKS.

Here is where those disagree: nothing known today, and the split is one day
old. The self-check is the same one Burnish applies to every repository,
`burnish critic ../Warden`; run it rather than trust this sentence.
